Project Weather Website

The Project Weather Website is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide real-time weather information to users. This website allows users to search for the weather conditions of any location worldwide.

The layout of the website is designed using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and user-friendly interface. The homepage features a search bar where users can input the name of a city or a specific location. Upon submitting the search query, JavaScript is used to handle the user input and interact with the OpenWeatherMap API.

The JavaScript code sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API, passing the user's input as a parameter. The API responds with a JSON object containing weather data for the specified location. The JavaScript code then extracts the relevant information from the API response, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Once the weather data is obtained, the JavaScript code dynamically updates the webpage, displaying the current weather conditions. This includes showing the temperature in Celsius, an icon representing the weather condition, and a brief description of the weather.

Overall, the Project Weather Website is a practical and interactive web application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to provide users with up-to-date weather information. It demonstrates the effective use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and visually appealing weather website.
